#01. To auto-format a code in Rust, it is possible to use the following command: 'cargo fmt'.

#02. It is possible to fix a code in Rust using the following command: 'cargo fix'.

#03. Cargo annotations:
    - We can create a project using cargo new.
    - We can build a project using cargo build.
    - We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
    - We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
    - Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.
